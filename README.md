# bnj_dance
 
_Hello! I developed this dancing system similar to the one found in the After Hours DLC. Created from scratch, using NativeUI_
 
### How to start 📋
 
_NativeUI is required for this to function_
 
```
start NativeUI
start bnj_dance
```
 
### Keybinds 🔧
 
 
```
F10 : Open / Close Menu
SHIFT : Change dancing style (Men and women have two different dances)
E : Increase Intensity
Q : Decrease Intensity
LEFT AND RIGHT ARROWS : Move arms in that direction
X : Stop dancing / animation
```
