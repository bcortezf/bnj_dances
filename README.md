# bnj_dances
 
_Hello! I developed this FiveM dancing script similar to the one found in the After Hours DLC. Created from scratch, using NativeUI and native Animations._


### How to start 📋
 
_NativeUI is required for this to function_

Add this to your server.cfg
```
start NativeUI
start bnj_dances
```
 
# Keybinds 🔧
 

__F10__ : Open / Close Menu

__SHIFT__ : Change dancing style (Men and women have two different dances each)

__E__ : Increase Intensity

__Q__ : Decrease Intensity

__LEFT AND RIGHT ARROWS__ : Move arms in that direction

__X__ : Stop dancing / animation

__ALT__:  Alternate between being able to walk while dancing, and dancing with your entire body (without moving)
